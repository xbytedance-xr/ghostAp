    Design a solution approach for spec completion control. Your approach should address:
    1. How to make goals explicit and trackable (goal decomposition schema)
    2. How to verify each goal is actually met before marking complete
    3. How to prevent premature termination (checkpoint/verification gates)
    4. How to surface completion status to users (per-goal progress)
    5. How to integrate with existing spec engine without major rewrites
    6. What existing patterns from other engines (workflow verify, deep hooks) can be reused

    Be specific about:
    - Data structures to add
    - Code modules to modify/add
    - State machine changes
    - Verification heuristics vs LLM-based checks
    - Integration points with existing spec flow
    - Backward compatibility considerations
