"""Task scheduling and tracking utilities.

This package provides a lightweight, thread-based task scheduler with:
- per-key ordered execution (project-level isolation)
- global concurrency limit
- task status tracking and progress events
- system command fast-track (bypasses per-key limit)

Queue key routing:
- System commands: {chat_id}:SYSTEM (high concurrency)
- Project tasks: {chat_id}:{project_id} (serial within project)
- No project: {chat_id}:DEFAULT (serial)
