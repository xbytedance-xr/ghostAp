"""Workflow-specific CardEvent factory functions.

Follows the same pattern as worktree.py — keeps workflow construction logic
separate from the core CardEvent class.

NOTE: These factory functions define the typed event API for workflow lifecycle
events. They are not yet wired into the handler layer (the handler currently
uses direct callback functions instead). These will be integrated when the
event bus architecture is adopted in a future iteration. Until then they serve
as the canonical payload contract and are exercised by tests/test_workflow_payloads.py.
