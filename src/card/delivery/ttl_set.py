"""TTLSet: bounded set with TTL-based expiry and self-contained thread safety.

Extracted from delivery/engine.py for independent testability and reuse.

Thread-safety: TTLSet is internally thread-safe (leaf lock). All public methods
acquire the internal lock before operating. Callers do NOT need to hold an
external lock for individual method calls. However, if callers need atomicity
across multiple TTLSet operations (e.g. add + __contains__), they must use their
own external lock for that compound operation.

    Uses an OrderedDict (insertion-ordered) with monotonic timestamps.
    Expired entries are lazily evicted via:
    - add(): batch-evicts consecutive expired entries from the head.
    - purge(): explicit batch eviction callable by the owner.
    A hard max_size cap ensures memory is bounded even without eviction.

    Thread-safety: Internally holds a threading.Lock (leaf lock — never
    acquired while holding any LockLevel lock). All public methods are safe
