"""CardSession lifecycle hooks.

Provides the SessionHook protocol and concrete implementations for
Feishu-specific side effects (emoji reactions, context persistence).

Hooks are injected at CardSession construction time and called at:
- on_dispatched(event, state): after reduce, before deliver
- on_terminal(state, reason): after terminal event delivery succeeds

All hook callbacks are wrapped in try/except by the caller (CardSession),
so a failing hook never blocks the dispatch pipeline.
Terminal hooks have a 5s timeout to prevent network hangs from blocking the pipeline.
