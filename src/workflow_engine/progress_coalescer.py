"""ProgressCoalescer — debounced async progress updates for workflow cards.

Prevents flooding Feishu with card updates by coalescing rapid-fire progress
events into at most one update per PROGRESS_DEBOUNCE_S interval.

Uses a daemon thread + threading.Event pattern:
- enqueue(snapshot) is fire-and-forget, updates _latest_snapshot under lock
- Daemon thread wakes every PROGRESS_DEBOUNCE_S seconds, takes the latest
  snapshot, renders the card, and calls the on_progress callback
- stop() forces a final flush to prevent losing the last update
