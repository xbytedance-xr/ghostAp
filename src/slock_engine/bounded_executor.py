class BoundedExecutor:
    """ThreadPoolExecutor wrapper with bounded queue depth and enqueue time tracking.

    This executor guarantees that at most *max_queue_size* tasks are pending
    (submitted but not yet completed) at any time.  Attempts to submit beyond
    this limit raise :class:`ExecutorQueueFullError`.

    Each returned :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` is annotated with an
    ``enqueue_time`` attribute (a :func:`time.time` timestamp) indicating when
    the task was accepted into the queue.

    Thread safety is ensured via an internal lock that makes the
    check-and-submit path atomic, avoiding TOCTOU race conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_workers:
        Number of worker threads in the underlying pool.
    max_queue_size:
        Maximum number of pending (submitted but incomplete) tasks allowed.
